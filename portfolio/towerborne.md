**Role:** Senior Game Designer (Quests, Missions)
**Platform:** PC 
**Tools:** Unreal Engine 5

<hr />

I'm currently working on [Towerborne](https://www.towerborne.com) as a Senior Game Designer.

My responsibilities:
* Designed and implemented all quests for Towerborne, working closely with our game writer reorganizing the core narrative of the game to improve engagement with story and characters, while wrangling 1000+ quest and dialogue assets across limited time and evergreen content.
* Served as main IC for tutorial missions, iterating on feedback gathered from numerous playtests and leveraging in-house mission design tools to create missions that would onboard players effectively without overwhelming them, as well as communicate the premise of the game.
* Pitched additional storytelling features to tools and engineering teams such as simultaneous quest objectives and mood animations for NPCs, augmenting the game's narrative capabilities. 
* Collaborated with liveops teams to improve player engagement and retention via seasonal event content, delivering multiple holiday events (Duskveil, Grandeur, Shiro's Golden Journey) that were well-received by our active playerbase.
