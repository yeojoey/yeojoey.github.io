**Tools:** Unreal Engine 4

<hr />

I worked on a *top secret* project at Schell Games!

My main responsibilities on it as a Game Designer were:
* Designing levels in UE4 that would be sufficiently challenging for expert gamers, but also accommodated first-timers for a mass-multiplayer live gaming experience
* Communicating with the client and contractors to process feedback and interate on designs
* Visiting the installation site with the team to set up and make on-the-spot adjustments based on real-life level geometry (aka, the 3D world)
* Writing scripts in Python to automate the import/export of spreadsheet data into game objects
* Creating Editor Utility Widgets in UE4 to speed up level construction and iteration
