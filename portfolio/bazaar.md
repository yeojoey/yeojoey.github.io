<hr />

I worked [The Bazaar](https://www.playthebazaar.com) from 2021-2022!

My main responsibilities as a Game Designer were:
* Designing creature, item and event concepts that are flavorful, balanced, and fun to experience
* Improving the workflow of other designers on the team by designing and implementing improvements to internal content creation tools
* Iterating on and evaluating feedback on content based on weekly internal playtests
* Writing specs for features to enable designers to create content quickly
