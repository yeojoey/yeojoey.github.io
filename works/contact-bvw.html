          <p class="portfolio-p"><i>Contact</i> was a world created in 2 weeks for the ETC's Building Virtual Worlds class. We were not allowed to give the guest any instructions before they played our world, and had to come up with a list of predictions of what our guest might do for the final demonstration.</p>
          <p class="portfolio-p">My team and I conceptualized this world as more of an interactive art and music piece, rather than a game. The guest starts off in an empty, dark forest and has to pick up a staff on the floor. Picking up the staff causes a large jellyfish-like creature to start following the staff; upon touching the staff, the creature lights it up like a torch and retreats to the large tree in the world. The main gameplay then starts, which involves the player locating and tapping on various jellyfish creatures with the staff, which each play a short musical phrase when tapped. When all the creatures of a single color have been tapped, a layer of instrumentation is added to the background music and the next set of creatures appear. At the end of the world, the largest jellyfish creature reappears to be lit up by the player, then thanks the player by lighting up the environment. Creatures of all colors now spawn at random intervals and the guest can continue to remain in the world, freely playing with the musical phrases as they wish.</p>
          <p class="portfolio-p">Because this world needed to be immediately appealing to guests, we spent a lot of time making sure we put them in a beautiful and soothing environment. Our base environmental art was created entirely in Tilt Brush, then exported as a 3D object and placed in Unity. We originally came up with the idea that the world should look like a secret garden, with the interactive creatures being butterflies, but we pivoted to a more alien-like world and decided to base the creatures on bio-luminescent jellyfish instead, to put a more creative spin on the theme. This ended up being a questionable choice, because our guest's immediate reaction to seeing a large, imposing jellyfish was to attempt to bat it away with the wand they were given, rather than allow it to light up (though eventually they would realize it was harmless).</p>
          <p class="portfolio-p">Nonetheless, keeping the only interaction in our world simple and intuitive was a good choice we made. We made sure that there was ample feedback when the guest had done the right thing with lighting and sound effects, in order for the interaction to be as satisfying as possible. We playtested for this with external testers, many of which had not had experience in VR, and made changes accordingly. </p>
          <p class="portfolio-p">On this project, along with contributing to the design process and conducting playtesting, I programmed the core interaction of the game, the system which controlled the sound effects and layers of music, and the system that spawned the creatures.</P>
