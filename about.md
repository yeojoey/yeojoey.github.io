Hi! I'm Joey and I'm a **game designer** and sometimes-programmer.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore. Now, I'm studying for a Master of Entertainment Technology at Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center.

I like making games which are *cozy*, *thoughtful* and/or *exciting* -- but I'm also very easily excited. I play all kinds of games.

Talk to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yeojoey) -- I'm always eager to chat about game design. I also write blog posts on game design [here](https://yeojoey.wordpress.com).
