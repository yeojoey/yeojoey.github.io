Hi! I'm Joey and I'm a **game designer** and sometimes-programmer. I hail from Singapore, but I now live in Brooklyn, NY.

Currently, I'm a Senior Game Designer at Stoic Studio, working on [Towerborne](https://www.towerborne.com/). Previously, I was a Game Designer at Tempo on   [The Bazaar](https://www.playthebazaar.com/), and before that, I was a Game Designer at Schell Games on a mass multiplayer live entertainment experience :)

I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore and a Master's in Entertainment Technology from Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center.

I'm good at designing game content that requires a technical eye, and I'm especially fond of working on tools that can help speed up the workflow of the other designers on the team.

My personal projects (game jams, etc.) can be found on my [Itch.io](https://yeojoey.itch.io).
