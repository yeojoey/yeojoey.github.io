Hi! I'm Joey and I'm a **game designer** and sometimes-programmer.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore. Now, I'm a Master of Entertainment Technology candidate at Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center.

Using my technical background, I like developing games with robust systems that utilize novel ways of interaction. I'm looking for full-time opportunities in game design for when I graduate in December 2019.

Talk to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yeojoey) -- I'm always eager to chat about game design. I also write blog posts on game design [here](https://yeojoey.wordpress.com).
